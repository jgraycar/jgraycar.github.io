**Cal Raijin Taiko** is UC Berkeley's Japanese drumming performance ensemble,
founded in 2005. I joined the team my first year of college, in 2012. Though
the team had an existing website already, it was difficult to update and
maintain, as it required someone with the knowledge and experience to remote
login to a server and edit the HTML of the live site.

In the summer of 2014, I decided to try and create a new web app for the team
that would simplify the upkeep process significantly. [My solution][GitHub]
was a Ruby on Rails app that allowed authorized users to log in and update the
site using simple forms and intuitive interactions. When the new site [went
live][caltaiko] that September, it was incredibly rewarding to see the fruits
of my summer labor pay off.
