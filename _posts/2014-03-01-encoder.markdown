One of the classes I've enjoyed most as an undergrad was [CS70][cs70], a course on Discrete Mathematics and probability theory. In particular, I was fascinated by our studies on modular arithmetic, and how it related to cryptography.

As we covered RSA encryption and Fermat's Little Theorem, I began thinking about how I might implement an encryption algorithm on my own. Using the topics we learned that semester, I came up with Encoder: a desktop application made using Java Swing that utilizes modular arithmetic to encrypt files at the byte level.
