In the Spring of 2015, I took the course **CS 169: Software Engineering**. One
of the main components of the class was a semester-long project in which teams
of six students would work with an external non-profit organization to solve
an issue of theirs using a [Software as a Service][SaaS] solution. My team was
assigned to the [Berkeley Student Cooperative][BSC], a student-run organization
that offered afforadble housing in return for a required number of hours of
housework each week from the residents.

The BSC currently used an online portal developed by one of their residents in
around 2005, and while it was fully functional, it presented its users with an
extremely unfriendly user interface, and lacked a number of features the work
shift managers strongly desired to speed up their management tasks.
